            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p> Hello my name is Jared Tanuwidjaja. I am a recent graduate from University of California Riverside with a bachelors in Computer Science. I am a problem solver in nature and enjoy employing technology to make life easier.
                My interests lie in Artificial Intelligance and Virtual/Augmented Reality. I hope to contribute to increasing accesibility to these technologies and improve quality of life for individuals.
                When I'm not programming, I spend time enjoying one of the activities from a growing list of hobbies such as rock climbing, gaming, music, and more.
